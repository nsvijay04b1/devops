[vagrant@centos73 root]$ docker info
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at tcp://192.168.1.70:2375. Is the docker daemon running?



After the installation finishes, Docker usually starts up on its own, but for the next part to work you will need to stop it.

sudo service docker stop

Then run the daemon with the following command:

sudo nohup docker daemon -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock &

To make working with Docker easier, you should add your username to 
the Docker users group. Adding a user to the group can be done with the 
command underneath by replacing the with your username.
sudo usermod -aG docker


It wors!!!
